The Furious Five were trained by Shifu as his students. Each of them attained the rank of master and won many battles, but none of them could win the one thing they all wanted: Shifu's approval and love. After his failure with Tai Lung, Shifu became a harsh and strict teacher to prevent history from repeating itself, but this only made his students feel inferior (as well as greatly pressured) and he drove them to try even harder to please him. They even went so far as to confront Tai Lung together, only to be defeated. It was then that Shifu showed emotional attachment to the Five and concern for their well-being. When he ordered them to evacuate the Valley, they were willing to do so, and it was at this time that Shifu admitted he was proud of them all.
