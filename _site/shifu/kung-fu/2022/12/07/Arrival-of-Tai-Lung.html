    <p>He determined that he would prove that Po wasn’t the true Dragon Warrior by treating him to many punishing “exercises”, believing the panda would swiftly bow under the stress and quit by morning. However, Po proved to be enthusiastic and determined, even under Shifu’s sharp verbal barbs and his own constant bumbling, which only serving to make Shifu become even more spiteful. It was two days into the panda’s “training”, and the distraught Shifu desperately meditated for inner peace, but was soon interrupted by Zeng, who had just arrived back from Chorh-Gom Prison with ominous news: Tai Lung had escaped and was coming back, just as Oogway had foreseen.</p>

<p>Anxious, Shifu sought out Oogway under the Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom, relaying the bad news. Oogway accepted the news calmly, saying that he had faith in Po as the Dragon Warrior and quietly admonished Shifu, telling him to be patient and nurture the panda instead of offering harshness. He then stated that his time had come, and that Shifu would have to continue without him. Oogway disappeared in a shower of peach petals and light as he passed away, leaving Shifu with his beloved peach-wood staff and a mountain of a problem to deal with.</p>
